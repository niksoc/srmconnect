             SRM has a student population exceeding ** 38, 000**. With that colossal amount of collective experience, surely we should be capable of extraordinary things. But real life doesn't work how we'd like it too.
             How easy is it to find someone with a particular expertise, be it for advice, mentorship or partnership?
             The guy sitting two rows behind you may be doing something amazing, but will you ever get to know?
             Let's face it, **we tend to stick to our circles.** And our circles are most often than not formed from proximity ( same classroom, same hostel floor) rather than similar professional/academic interests. It's plain difficult to meet and filter from so many people.
             The ** goal of srmXchange ** is to give ** you ** the student, a platform to:
             - find the 5 or 20 people whose company you can benefit from
             - learn from the experience of the all those before and around you
             - know what's happening and be inspired by the work of your fellow students.

             This is a community site, only as strong as the community is. So let's help each other to push our limits.
             I'm sure we can, after all, we are legion!
